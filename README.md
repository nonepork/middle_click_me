# middle click this picture

A website for a little trolling, totally not just modified dlcord code.

Basically, when you post the website link to discord, it'll appear as an image.
But when a user middle click it, it redirects user to a rickroll page.

By identifying what user-agent tries to GET, we can achieve this trick.
But I'm not that familiar with website, so I deciede to: https://github.com/fionafibration/cdn.dlcordapp.com
